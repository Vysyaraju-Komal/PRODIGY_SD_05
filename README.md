I have successfully created a program that extracts product information such as names, prices, and ratings from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a structured format like a CSV file. 

This task involved:
✅ Learning and implementing web scraping techniques.
✅ Using Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas to collect and manage data.
✅ Understanding website structures and HTML elements to accurately extract relevant data.

It was a great opportunity to strengthen my web scraping skills and learn more about data extraction from websites! 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more about this project or discuss web scraping techniques!
